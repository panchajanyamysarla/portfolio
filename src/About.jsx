        <p className="text-textMain mb-6">
          Hello! I’m Panchajanya, a software engineer who enjoys building things
          that help people life better. I specialize in creating (and
          occasionally designing) exceptional websites, applications, and
          everything in between.
        </p>
        <p className="text-textMain mb-6">
          I am a Senior Software Engineer specializing in Energy Technology,
          Real-time Distributed Computing, and Cloud-native Application
          Development. With over nine years of experience, I have led the design
          and development of globally impactful software products at companies
          like Google X (Tapestry), VMware, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.,
          and Fitch Ratings.
        </p>
        <p className="text-textMain mb-6">
          My expertise lies in building scalable platforms that drive
          operational efficiency, optimize clean energy integration, and enable
          real-time decision-making through predictive analytics and advanced
          data visualization. At Google X’s Tapestry, I played a pivotal role in
          developing the Grid Operations Tool, enabling real-time forecasting,
          demand management, and grid reliability for energy grids serving
          millions of consumers globally.
        </p>
        <p className="text-textMain mb-6">
          Previously, at VMware, I spearheaded the development of the Tanzu CLI
          and its Plugin Developer Tools, accelerating cloud-native application
          development and enhancing developer productivity by 200%. My
          contributions helped streamline Kubernetes-based workloads across
          enterprise-scale platforms.

        <p className="text-textMain">
          I am passionate about building robust, scalable solutions that solve
          real-world problems. I thrive at the intersection of energy
          technology, cloud infrastructure, and data-driven decision systems,
          collaborating with cross-functional teams to design mission-critical
          applications with lasting global impact.
